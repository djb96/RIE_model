The R code presented here was used in the work outlined in "Overcoming the lack of authentic standards for the quantification of biogenic secondary organic aerosol markers", Bryant et al.

The code aims to build a model to predict the relative ionisation efficiencies of small organic compounds analysed via liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry.
